# Mask-Detection-Using-Python

The Face Mask Detection System is an intelligent solution designed to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks or not in real-time. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze video streams or images, identifying faces and determining whether a face mask is present. The system aims to contribute to public health and safety, particularly in environments where the use of face masks is essential for preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

Important things:
-	First, upload the dataset on your google drive
-	Mount Google Drive to the Google collab code file.
-	Change the file location in code files with respect to your drive location 
-	Change runtime of google collaboratory to “GPU”
-	Run code cells sequentially.
